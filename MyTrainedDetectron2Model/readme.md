My homework trains the Detectron2 model on plate, mug, and bowl images.  Part 3 of the code shows how to run the trained model while Part 1 and Part 2 show how I trained the model and the various steps that I took.

To Run My Colab:
Go to Part 3 of my code and run the installation of detectron2
Download my trained model configuration files below and upload to your google drive 
Download my movie video and upload to your google drive
Run the remaining code to view results
